       <h3><a href="/blog/new-oab-2016">Take Action this Open Access Week with the new Open Access Button</a> <small>2016-10-28</small></h3>
      <p>We're excited to announce the release of the new Open Access Button. During the past six months we’ve been quiet, but magic was going on behind the scenes. Over the coming months we’ll talk more about what’s happened, what’s changed, and what’ll happen next.</p>

      <h3><a href="/blog/open-data-button-is-here">New app helps researchers share data openly</a> <small>2016-03-07</small></h3>
      <p>The Open Access Button today announces the beta release of the Open Data Button, a tool to help people find the data underlying 
        research papers and request the release of new data. Every day, researchers cannot access the research data needed to verify 
        results and build on others’ research. Open research data increases the reproducibility and transparency of research, and 
        enables greater innovation. The Open Data Button app is available for Chrome and can be downloaded for free at opendatabutton.org.
